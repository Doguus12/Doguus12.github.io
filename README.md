# About Me
 This is Dogus Ali Metin and I am from Turkey, Istanbul. I've been in the States for almost three years. I'm studying Computer programming and development.
## My Interests
I do like playing soccer; this is my favorite sport. I've been playing since 6 years old. Also, I am trying to go to the gym four days per week. But this semester I am pretty busy I usually stay home and do my assignments.
## Websites I Recommend
- [X] (https://X.com) - I always check X which is the old name called Twitter. Daily news, something interesting news about the world, and of course follow the soccer news.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - We can find any type of video on YouTube. It's the pretty old application or website but it is still cool!
